    Sensor Community API

    This is the API for the Sensor Community. There are two domains where the same data is served.  https://api.luftdaten.info - This is optimized for receiving data. DON'T use this to request data.  https://data.sensor.community - This is faster and more reliable for serving data, so should be used for reporting cases. Where it is not supported for a certain endpoint, the previous domain must be used.  # noqa: E501
